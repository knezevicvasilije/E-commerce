First homework (ecommerce)

On the home page below the navbar is a slider with three slides made of individual elements.
The products from Feature categories and New Arrivals  have hover animation as in the design.
This is done using pseudo elements.
Implemented animations from the site (https://animate.style/) were used on logos from the category SHOP BY BRANDS.

Two Animations from scratch were applied on the About us page, which can be accessed from the footer using the link of the same name.
One is the typing title and the other is the academy logo displayed on the hover of a short biography.

The third page is also accessed via link from the footer (Contact Us)

You can return to the home page by clicking on the Bazar logo or by clicking on Home from navbar.

The home page was made according to the given design and I designed the other two myself. 

The whole site is responsive and can be used on mobile, tablet and desktop.
